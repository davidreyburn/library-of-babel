# Roadmap

What is open, in rough order of value, and what would say each one is done.

This is the only document that schedules work. The specification says what the
Library is and what was built ([`spec/technical-specification.md`](spec/technical-specification.md));
the bug log says how each defect was found ([`docs/BUG-LOG.md`](docs/BUG-LOG.md));
the case study says how the whole thing was made ([`docs/CASE-STUDY.md`](docs/CASE-STUDY.md)).
Where one of those records an unresolved gap, the item below carries the decision.

## Where it stands

Green: **138 core assertions**, **41 gates**, 500 GPU integers, build current
against `core/`. `CORE_VERSION` is **0.5.0**. Walking somewhere on purpose
arrives 197 times in 200 and says why when it does not.

The corridor closed §9.3, the last part of the specification that had been
written and not built: the hallway is a cell type, about 1 cell in 11, with a
mirror, a latrine or a standing closet in alcoves off it, and a flight of
stairs at the end of 1 in 5. LIB-P-020, 021, 023 and 024 are met. LIB-P-022 —
the stairway *inside* the hallway — remains deviated for the same reason
stairs got their own cells in the first place (§17.1, T-4).

Nothing in the specification is now specified-and-unbuilt. What follows is
defects, unmeasured costs, and reach.

## Open

### 1. The mottling, not signed off

Two real mechanisms were found and fixed — an over-reporting distance field on
the spines, a step function on bare stone (spec §17.14, bug log §11) — but two
earlier fixes for the same symptom had been announced prematurely, and the
reporter's verdict on the third was *"I don't know if this fully got it."*

**Lever:** somebody walks a long way and looks. If it recurs, look for a
*third* mechanism; the two named are established, not suspected.
**Done when:** a long traverse across several floors turns up nothing, or a
third mechanism is named and measured.

### 2. A 160 ms worst frame, uncharacterised

Seen on the reporter's own panel while the mean sat at 8.1 ms. This
repository's own method says a mean is the wrong instrument for a stutter, and
here we have only the mean explained.

**Lever:** measure the distribution before theorising — the panel already
carries worst-beside-mean. Find what the spike correlates with (entering a
reading room, first sight of a mirror, a shader recompile).
**Done when:** the spike has a named cause, or a frame-time histogram shows it
was a one-off.

### 3. The corridor changes cost 13% of a frame

Raising corridors to 10% and restoring the richer axis rule took a gallery
from 6.58 ms to 7.45 ms at 1550×945.

**Lever:** hoist `corridorAxis` out of `cellDesc`'s six `gapAt` calls — but
that means stating the corridor's gap rule twice, which is the thing `core/`
exists to prevent (§17.10). Weigh that before taking it.
**Cheaper alternatives:** fewer corridors, or back to the flat axis rule at
the price of one-ended corridors going 2.7% → 7.2%.
**Done when:** a gallery is back under 7 ms, or the cost is accepted in
writing and this item closes as won't-fix.

### 4. Rippled chunks missing from a book's cover, seen from the side

At a grazing angle the edge of a volume tears into ripples. This may already
be gone — same overshoot signature as the spine mottling, which the
conservative shelving field fixed — but nobody has checked.

**Lever:** one look at a shelf edge-on, then the normal-visualisation mode if
it is still there.
**Done when:** checked either way. It is cheap and it has been open longest.

### 5. Rung 6 with a real policy

Point a language model at the same seam the synthetic policies use and read
its citation integrity. Everything it needs exists: the seam, the oracle, the
transcript format, four gates.

**Why it is the most interesting item here:** every other number in this
project describes the Library. This one would describe a reader. It is the
first measurement nobody in this project has taken, and the environment was
built for it — see [`core/RUN.md`](core/RUN.md).
**Done when:** an integrity figure exists for at least one real model over a
real excursion, alongside the `honest` / `fabricator` / `random` /
`adversary` baselines.

### 6. Mouse capture done properly

What ships today is an imitation — hidden cursor and edge-turning — and the
user was right that it *"doesn't feel totally legit"*. Real pointer lock is
impossible inside an artifact frame, which is sandboxed without
`allow-pointer-lock`; served at top level it already works.

**Lever:** once this has a durable home outside the artifact frame, delete the
imitation rather than build on it.
**Blocked on:** where this lives.

### 7. The last hand-written mirror

The hash deciding which slots the Purifiers emptied lives inside the shader's
`mapAt`, too entangled with the SDF to extract as it stands, so
`volumePresent()` in `core/babel-core.mjs` is a hand-written twin guarded only
by a statistical test (3.52% empty over 1.8 million slots). That test would
catch a broken mirror, not a subtly different one — and a subtly different one
is exactly what the GLSL/JS split produced twice before (§17.10).

**Lever:** extract it the next time `mapAt` is opened for any other reason.
**Done when:** `volumePresent` is single-sourced and appears in
`core/vectors.json`, so the GPU conformance harness covers it.

### 8. Tune how often a mirror turns up

One cell in 52 is a third guess, not a measured answer to anything. A wander
meets a mirror on 189 routes in 200, median step 56.

**Lever:** the frequencies are named constants and one kit table in
`babel-core.mjs`; moving them moves nothing else.
**Done when:** somebody decides what rate they want and says why.

### 9. A Three.js port, if a durable build is ever wanted

Not scheduled. Recorded so the question does not have to be re-asked: the
lattice and the corpus are already portable — `core/` has no renderer in it,
and `core/vectors.json` plus `core/conformance.html` are how a second renderer
would prove it agrees. The work is the SDF, not the Library.

*Items 1, 2 and 4 are defects. 3 and 7 are debts with a known price. 5 is the
only one that would tell us something new.*
